Don't have much to share during the transition period. My old half baked notes were recently taken down by myself(I am actually surprised that people actually looked at them). I may or may not come back to them in the future.

<div class="content">

Actually, I get most of my math/physics news from these sites.<br>

<a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/">
John Baez's Stuff</a><br>

<a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/">
Not Even Wrong</a><br>

<a href="http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~kwlan/math_links.html">
Kai-Wen Lan's Math Links</a><br>

<a href="http://www.numbertheory.org/">
Number Theory Web</a><br>

I came to realize, halfway through my master's studies, that these sites are really intended for consumptions, not productions. In particular, surfing them should not be counted as works. They are more like entertainments. (Keep in mind that watching reality TV shows and playing video games are also entertainments.) This also applies to surfing ArXiv. Is surfing ArXiv really more productive than surfing Reddit?

<h5>Tools</h5>
A <a href="https://tikzcd.yichuanshen.de/">website</a> to draw commutative diagram based on tikzcd. It does the job if you just want some quick diagrams. Be wanred that the previews do not always agree with the outputs produced by some Tex Editors(such as TexMaker).<br>
<br>
Are you actually as productive as you think you are? Are you working effectively and efficiently?(By the way, are you working at all or just trying to pretend to work?) What is your APM? Here is an <a href="https://www.manictime.com/">app</a> to track the hours spent on various tasks(accurate to documents). There is also <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-activity-time-tracker/hhfnghjdeddcfegfekjeihfmbjenlomm?hl=en">an extension</a> for Chromium browsers that does the same thing. It has a little timer that helps you track the total time(in a day) spent on the current website in real time.<br>
