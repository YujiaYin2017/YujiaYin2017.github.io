The point of writing up this note was to familiarize myself with scattering-theoretic aspects of automorphic forms. This motivation has not been made explicit in this version. One general theme demonstrated by the example in the end is to express arithmetic data in terms of geometric data. The typography is really a mess. I was not experienced at typesetting very long expressions.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Class field theory</button>
<div class="content">
These are notes based on the informal regular meetings on Class field theory with friends over the summer of 2021. The initial goals were to present Class field theory and its connection to the Langlands program in a narrative different from those taken by the usual expository articles and talks(but well-known to experts), and to provide the necessary background materials(at least the catchy words and slogans) for my MSc thesis. I now realize it is unwise to popularize prematurely. Everything should be burnt and rewritten.<br>

Still under construction, probably will be completed much later than the other notes on class field theory. This note is more like an essay, because it consists of mostly recollections of facts and definitions, and has almost no hard proofs. The real objective is to present some evidences for the possibility of "geometrizing" (global instead of local) number fields.<br>

The primary motivation behind Artin's reciprocity law, in addition to perfecting class field theory(e.g. establishing functoriality) as was known at the time, was to unify all the reciprocity laws discovered up to that point. I am attempting to explicitly rewrite these classical laws in terms of Artin reciprocity.<br>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B-DhkShNXgK_vpDu79NvPBVz2PKWkwvu/view?usp=sharing">Class Field Theory:  The Kronecker-Weber Theorem 2021-6-4</a><br>
The Kronecker-Weber theorem is the first case of class field theory. Due to the simplicity of abelian extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$, many computations can be carried out explicitly. In particular, it is considered a case of explicit class field theory. It also is the model for many modern approaches to the reciprocity problem. I try to indicate how some of them trace back to this classical theorem.<br>

Moving towards the automorphic side of the Langlands program. This(together with the definition of automorphic L-functions) is how Class field theory usually gets introduced in a typical talk about the Langlands program.<br>

Introducing some of the main ingredients of the Langlands program: automorphic representations, L groups, and automorphic L-functions. The takeaway is that Hecke L-functions are automorphic L-functions for $GL(1)$.<br>

I was interested in formal geometry(in connection with deformation theory) at the time of writing the first draft of this note in 2020. There aren't enough details to the section about index theorem for deformation quantization,which I am yet to understand.
