Don't have much to share during the transition period.<br>

In my past life, I was a mediocre pure math generalist. I did a little bit of everything, specifically automorphic forms and complex algebraic geometry, but couldn't manage to ship out a single thing in the end. All I ended up doing was writing up a bunch of design docs, coming up with project wikis(<span>&#8220;</span>notes<span>&#8221;</span>), and strategizing. Ironically, for the very few projects that actually mattered, I just started hustling without design docs, got stuck with inconsistencies, had to call for SOS to rescue me.<br>

My old half baked notes were recently taken down by myself(It surprises me that people actually looked at them). I may or may not come back to them in the future. <span style="color: black; background: black;">Most likely not, because I no longer believe in mathematics non-executable by a computer.</span>

<h5>Tools</h5>
A <a href="https://tikzcd.yichuanshen.de/">website</a> to draw commutative diagram based on tikzcd. It does the job if you just want some quick diagrams. Be wanred that the previews do not always agree with the outputs produced by some Tex Editors(such as TexMaker).<br>
<br>
Are you actually as productive as you think you are? Are you working effectively and efficiently? What is your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actions_per_minute"> APM</a>? Here is an <a href="https://www.manictime.com/">app</a> to track the hours spent on various tasks(accurate to documents). There is also <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-activity-time-tracker/hhfnghjdeddcfegfekjeihfmbjenlomm?hl=en">an extension</a> for Chromium browsers that does the same thing. It has a little timer that helps you track the total time(in a day) spent on the current website in real time. For the real world, I recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B08HVRF4R9/">this kitchen timer </a> <br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">What I am not interested in</button>
<div class="content">
Philosophy/Motivations/Heuristics. Talk is cheap, show me the punchlines.<br>

Fancy, gradiose words. I assume all catchy phrases are bs' unless proven otherwise.<br>

Pedagogy. This is not a priority for me. I leave the debates and discussions to experts and people who are passionate about this stuff. I only implement the instructions I received. If there is still room left, I implement what has been examined.<br>

Gossips. "Great minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, small minds discuss people."<br>

News/Politics/Activisms. I don't read news.<br>
Ranking and comparing. "Which undergraduate course is the hardest?", "Which professor is the toughest?", "Pure v.s Applied", "Theories v.s Experiments", "Analysis v.s Algebra", "School A v.s School B", "Department X v.s Department Y", "Textbook Alpha v.s Textbook Beta", "Gauss v.s Tesla", "Newton above Hodge", etc, etc. Sure, whatever you say is cool is probably cool. But are you cool?<br>
